Introduction:
-------------

Mod_Authnz_Certs is an Apache module used for authentication.  The Apache
HTTP Daemon can be configured to require users to supply logins and passwords
before accessing pages in some directories.  Authentication is the process
of checking if the password given is correct for a user.  Apache has
standard modules for authenticating out of several different kinds of
databases.  Mod_Authnz_Certs is a tool allowing apache to *blindly* trust 
a user based on the client certificate he provides, or use another 
authentification mechanism.

Compatibility:
--------------

The current version of mod_authnz_certs is designed for use with Apache 2.2.
It will not work with older versions of Apache.
